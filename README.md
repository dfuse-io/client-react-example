## dfuse Client Library - React Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and
showcase how to use [dfuse Client Library](https://github.com/dfuse-io/eosws-js) to easily stream
all transfers happening in Mainnet in a streaming fashion.

First install all the dependencies:

    yarn install

Then simply launch the development mode to see the end results:

    REACT_APP_DFUSE_API_TOKEN=<your dfuse API token here> yarn start

Once it has started, simply open http://localhost:3000 in a browser
to test the example.

### Requirements

You will need to have a `REACT_APP_DFUSE_API_TOKEN` environment variable defined
before starting the development server.

Obtain a free API token by visiting https://dfuse.io.
